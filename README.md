# Team & OnboardingAI

## Team
- Nico Sharei
- Kiduk Kang
- Artem Bisliouk
- Marc Becker
- Ludwig Fügner

## Solution

Thanks to the great teamwork I am proud to report that we were able to implement **OnboardingAI** in 24 hours.

**OnboardingAI** is a service that generates a personalized step-by-step onboarding process using LLMs together with Retrieval Augmented Generation based on company, employee and specific management requirements.

# The Challenge
**Artificial Intelligence** for Evidence-Based Decision-Making in Public Spaces:
Develop algorithms and models to analyze data from various sources to support informed decisions in policy areas such as healthcare, education, and environmental protection.

# Introduction
Imagine you're at the forefront of the public sector, where the weight of your decisions can ripple through communities, shaping lives and our environment. Yet, amidst this vast responsibility, you're often navigating through a fog of complex data, bureaucratic processes, as well as urgent timelines and high-stakes scenarios. It's a delicate balance: acting swiftly without sacrificing accuracy or depth. Picture a future where AI assists you in quickly identifying patterns, predicting outcomes, highlighting the most impactful decisions. Bring the public sector into a new era of evidence-based decision-making with AI as your cornerstone.

# Outcome & Deliverables
